        <h2>Ruling Class; Ruling Ideas</h2>
        <h3>Friday, October 20, 2017</h3>
        <p> 
The appearance of the manifestation of dominant ideas being separate from the ruling class is an illusion. This illusion occurs because the dominant ideas appear as universal truths that serve the general public. Marx argues, instead, that these ruling ideas are produced not organically, but by the ruling class to reinforce their role in society. Marx claims that “[t]he class which has the means of material production at its disposal consequently also controls the means of mental production” (47). For Marx, the control over the means of mental production is a “consequence” because the class with control over the means of material production also has the power to naturalize the dissemination of their ideas, and the willingness to maintain their dominant position in society. 
        </p>
        <p>
One reason the ruling class has this power is due to the division of labour. Just as the division of labour in material production separates the ruling few who own the factories from the labouring majority who work in them, it “manifests itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labour,” (Marx, 47-48). While the majority of workers (and the ruling class) are busy with their jobs in material production, a few “thinkers” of the ruling class have the leisure time to actively engage in the mental production of ideas and illusions about their class (Marx, 48). To the average passive worker busied with daily tasks, as a consequence, constant exposure to these ideas in media can culminate into the belief of one general dominant idea about society, seemingly self-determined and developed naturally over time. This belief leads to the view that ruling ideas are separate from the ruling class. For example, thinking that “during the time the aristocracy was dominant, the concepts of honour, loyalty, etc., were dominant” (Marx, 48). Due to the differences in division of labour, the presence of “thinkers” gives the ruling class the time resource necessary to actively spread these illusions, while the average worker who lacks this resource of mental production can only passively accept the illusions as natural universal truths. But how does subscribing society to these illusions benefit the ruling class, and why do they make them?
        </p>
        <p>
The ruling class has the time and material means to develop and distribute their ideas, but their willingness to do so is tied directly to their goal, in society, to justify and maintain their rule as a class. “The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relations, the dominant relations grasped as ideas” (Marx, 47). To remain the owners of factories, the ruling class must maintain their dominant relationship with the workers of the factories, and naturalize their position in society as rational. In order to accomplish these two requirements, they must express the presence of factories to the general public as a universally accepted ideology of how society is meant to function. They must convince workers, through their “thinkers” and their distribution of illusions in the media, that willingly giving up their labour to power the factories is in their own best interest. In other words, the reason the ruling class want, and have, control over mental production is because doing so allows them to replenish the labour supply needed to retain their control over material production; they only do so, and want to do so, because it fulfills the requirements to cement their position as necessary to the rest of society.
        </p>
        <p>
Yet due to the passive nature with which the majority of society (and the ruling class) receive ideas from media, the illusion of dominant ideas existing independently in society is still upheld, because the ideas are separated empirically from the ruling class. They are believed to be “forms of self-determination” developed organically over time, or the conclusions of famous ideologists and theorists and philosophers of a given period in time (Marx, 49). People believe these ideas exist independently because these ideas have “the form of universality” (Marx, 48). The presence of factories, for example, appear to be in the best interest of every member in the society. However, with both the means of production and the motivation to produce dominant ideas in the hands of the ruling class, it is evident that the autonomous existence of dominant ideas is truly just an illusion. Instead of passively consuming the illusions that ruling class “thinkers” actively formulate, we must learn to question the conventional way of thinking, and challenge the ideas we once thought were universal.
