        <h2>Saussure: The Link Is Arbitrary</h2>
        <h3>Friday, September 29, 2017</h3>
        <p> 
	“The link between signal and signification is arbitrary” (Saussure, 67). Before arguing the consequences of this assertion it is important to first define the terms, signal and signification, in the context of a linguistic sign. The signal (sound pattern) is “the hearer’s psychological impression of a sound” (Saussure, 66), the signification (concept) is the idea associated with that particular sound pattern, and the linguistic sign “refers to … the word form” (67) that links a sound pattern and concept. Saussure’s argument can be expressed more simply as “the linguistic sign is arbitrary” (67). He means there is nothing intrinsic in a given signal that makes its associated signification inevitable. In theory, any sound pattern could potentially be arbitrarily linked to any other concept.
        </p>
        <p>
	To make sense of the implications of Saussure’s assertion, another term must first be clarified. What Saussure doesn’t mean by the term arbitrary is the “power [for an individual] to alter a sign … once it has become established in a linguistic community” (68). A speaker cannot arbitrarily and independently decide on a new sound pattern for an already established sign, for example. Instead, Saussure implies that the signal in a sign is arbitrary only in relation to the signification. In French, the sequence of sounds s-ö-r act as a signal for the idea of a sister. No natural connection is present between signal and signification, however, and the idea of a sister may as well “be represented by any other sequence of sounds” (Saussure, 68). S-ö-r derives its meaning solely from conventions of the French linguistic community, and the fact that it’s not any other signal in the language.
        </p>
        <p>
	Signs are therefore not derived from natural connections, but from “collective habit” within a society (Saussure, 68). The concept of an ox is represented by the signal b-ö-f in France, yet the same idea is represented by o-k-s in Germany. This example illustrates that the link between signal and signification is arbitrary. Same significations have different signals in different linguistic communities, depending on what sound pattern was collectively agreed upon to trigger the psychological impression of the concept. Languages are semiological systems. Linguistic signs are determined arbitrarily in different languages, but only established through shared convention. Thus, one implication of this arbitrary difference in words is the belief that linguistic signs should be studied synchronically rather than diachronically. There is no use in studying the linguistics system as it changes over time, because there is no natural connection between the phonetic evolution of words over time and their associated meanings. Linguistic signs are arbitrarily established through conventions of a given time period.
        </p>
        <p>
	A consequence of Saussure’s assertion is the seemingly contradictory presence of onomatopoeic words. “Onomatopoeic words might … show that a choice of signal is not always arbitrary” (Saussure, 69). These words argue that signs may be derived from the imitation of sounds instead of an arbitrary sequence of sounds. This is wrong. “Onomatopoeia is only the approximate imitation … of sounds” (Saussure, 69). For example, a French dog’s bark is signaled by ouaoua, while a German dog’s bark is signaled by wauwau. Onomatopoeia is not only rare but already arbitrary in the sense that the sound imitations are different depending on the linguistic structure of a community and that community’s collective interpretation of the sound in word form. Onomatopoeic words are also subjected to the same “phonetic and morphological evolution” as other words (Saussure, 69). Words of onomatopoeic origin may eventually lose their original meanings and become yet another arbitrary linguistic sign over time. This idea further supports the implication that linguistics should be studied at one point in time, rather than looking at its arbitrary evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
    Saussure argues the sign is arbitrary due to a lack of natural linking between signal and signification. And users of a language can not independently and arbitrarily alter signs that have been collectively established in a community. Then consequently, if not natural, the sign is differential. Linguistic signs define signals not by their natural connections to significations, but by which signals they are not. Since words are derived arbitrarily in a given time period, they only make sense when their phonic and spelling differences are compared to other words in the same language, in the same time period. Every arbitrary sign, or word, in a language generates its meaning by not being any other sign in that language. Meaning is generated by the language itself, rather than by users. Consequently, users don’t speak language, language speaks its users.
