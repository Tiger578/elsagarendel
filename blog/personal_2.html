        <h2>Super Bowl Advertisements and Gender: Expressive or Performative?</h2>
        <h3>Friday, November 24, 2017</h3>
        <p> 
	One of the many things the Super Bowl is known for is its big budget TV commercials. This is evident when taking a look at the countless advertisement montages on YouTube that have amassed tens of millions of views (TrendCrave, “Top 10 Super Bowl”). One popular ad by Snickers cleverly uses two performances of Marilyn Monroe to illustrate how a Snickers candy bar can rejuvenate a person’s energy when they’re hungry. A cranky male Monroe on set begins to complain about the scene being shot, before taking a bite off a Snickers bar and turning into a happy female Monroe, and the shoot continues. But the ad connotes more beyond the surface of a funny gender-bender skit. The Snickers commercial uses known gender performances to naturalize gender as expressive, rather than gender as performative. The expressive model of gender is “the notion of a true gender identity” (Butler, 157). Through this ad, viewers are encouraged to see gender as the natural expression of biological sex. 
        </p>
        <p>
	One example of a gender-sex binary performance established by culture is the performance of the passive female versus the active male. Snickers furthers this behavioural distinction in their ad in two ways. When Ms. Monroe is cranky, she is portrayed as a male with both a masculine outer appearance and a masculine inner essence (TrendCrave, “Top 10 Super Bowl”). Her complaints are actively verbalized, but only through the guise of a male performer. The ad signifies to viewers that activity, rather than passivity, is a masculine performance naturally associated with men and the male sex. Alternatively, the ad disassociates the performance of activity from femininity, because male Ms. Monroe is told “[she’s] not [herself] when [she’s] hungry” (“Top 10 Super Bowl”). That slogan suggests that the activity of voicing complaints is uncharacteristic for a woman; a woman is only herself when she is a female, acting feminine and passively cooperating.
        </p>
        <p>
	The casual viewer may not find anything wrong with the way the two different sexes were used to portray Ms. Monroe’s cranky and content traits. But would it seem wrong if the male and female roles were reversed? It shouldn’t. According to Butler, “acts and gestures… create the illusion of an interior and organizing gender core” (157). Portraying the vocal and angry Ms. Monroe as male creates the illusion that such a gender performance is orchestrated by some inherent quality of being a male. In reality, sex does not define gender. Gender is “instituted… through a stylized repetition of acts” (Butler, 159). If the script was flipped, a female playing the masculine role and a male playing the feminine role may seem wrong to some viewers, but that is only because such acts are rarely repeated, in cultural texts like the Snickers ad, and thus appear abnormal. Butler explains that gender is only legitimized through repetition that is “a re-enactment and re-experiencing of a set of meanings already socially established” (159). Therefore, passivity and activity aren’t masculine or feminine traits inherent of females or males, they are only associated together in this binary configuration because advertisements that use established gender performances and casual viewers who passively absorb these performances have legitimized these notions about gender through constant repetition over time. By seeing through the illusion of the presence of a gender core within sex, one can identify how gender is simply a culturally constructed phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
	 The gendered qualities in the ad can be seen when deconstructing the performances of the male and female Ms. Monroe. For example, one can identify the cultural perceptions about makeup by looking at the connotations associated with it in the ad. The image of Ms. Monroe with no makeup is negatively connoted by an angry male, while the same woman with makeup is positively connoted by a happy female (TrendCrave, “Top 10 Super Bowl”). The ad suggests two things: a woman’s natural state should be female, and makeup is a feminine characteristic. Thus, the message that the female sex should display femininity through the use of makeup is normalized and the expressive model is perpetuated.
        </p>
        <p>
	 To counter this, Butler argues we should see gender as “not expressive but performative” (160). Rather than being a natural expression of our sex, gender is actually produced through acting like a man or a woman. However, the consequence of not performing the gender associated with our sex is high. Snickers’s slogan tells us Ms. Monroe, as a male in a dress, “is not [herself]” (TrendCrave, “Top 10 Super Bowl”). The message is that a male who performs his gender in feminine clothes should not be considered as a woman. “As a strategy for survival within compulsory systems, gender is a performance with clearly punitive consequences” (Butler, 159). The male in a dress is subsequently punished to eat a Snickers bar so that he may change. Alternatively, the Ms. Monroe who is acting like a man is punished with a Snickers bar so that she may change. Like the notion of the Panopticon, the Snickers bar in the ad internalizes punishment in viewers for failing to perform in a certain way, so that they may police themselves to perform their assigned gender in the “normal” way. Gender is “a construction that regularly conceals its genesis” (Butler, 159). The repetition of acting and policing conceals the fact that the repetitions themselves are what define a gender, without which there would be no gender and no “normal” way.
        </p>
        <p>
	Looking back at the Snickers ad, one can assume that every characteristic portrayed by the male versus the female was determined by past gender performances, repeated to naturalize the binary relationship between sex and gender that culture has established. Rather than taking the expressive model for granted, we should acknowledge the confusion of nature and culture present in advertisement. We should introduce new gender performance styles into history so that, through their repetition, the idea of one natural gender may be disassociated from sex.
